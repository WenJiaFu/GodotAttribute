这是一个尝试在Godot引擎从零开始编写属性管理系统的工程示例，参考了UE5中GAS的一些概念搭建而来。
目前功能还十分有限，仅包含了基础的数值操作（Modifier）和简单的Buff机制。
作为基础框架示例，可以自行扩展。
Godot引擎运行版本为v4.4.1

This is an engineering example of attempting to create an attribute management system from scratch using the Godot engine. It is built based on some concepts from GAS in UE5.
The current functionality is still very limited, only including basic numerical operations (Modifiers) and a simple Buff mechanism.
As a basic framework example, you can also expand it yourself.
Godot engine is v4.4.1
